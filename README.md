<h1>Investing is Beautiful</h1>

<h2> :sparkles:Ambition: </h2>
I wanted to marry the passion I have of investing and coding together. The end goal of which is for Investing is Beautiful (IIB) to do the following.

- Auto-analysis of any listed stock of choice
- Allows users to customise what parts of the analysis they wish to be shown & hidden
- Keeps repositories of stocks that users have analysed including user's personal notes

<h2> :pencil:Method: </h2>
Using a MERN stack, combined with Data Visualisation tool Chart.JS, I should be able to create a scalable Web-application.
Currently has the following features:

- Data Visualisation using ChartJS
- MongoDB database storing the following
- Ability for Admin to post "blogs" which will be turned into a repository for the user's notes.
- Web Page to show existing repositories the user uploaded

Features I wish to include:

- Hook up data visualisation with IEX API for listed stock data
- User Authentication 
- Individual User storage for their stock analysis

In the works!
